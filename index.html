            <p>This not-for-profit was the brainchild of my good friend Julian Nadeau. Seeking to bring the joys of coding and design to kids, I took on the role of managing director and cofounder. Over 2 years we reached almost 800 kids, 4 cities, and countless lines of code. The highlights included being named in the top fold of the Globe and Mail, and being featured on TV in Montreal.</p>
