Our brains sort of suck. There are a billion different things that can go wrong with it, it weakens as you age, and - if we are being real here - it really likes to mess with us too.

Procrastination is one of the worst thing our brains can do to us. 

It is exam time, and a lot of the stress around us is self-inflicted because of procrastinating and apathy finally catching up to everyone. 

Why is it that I know I have to study for my final exam tomorrow, but instead I'm writing this blog post? Why am I able to so easily justify spending my time playing with my cat or watching TV but studying is for *later?*

I should go on a long rant about *wanting* to do things vs *needing* to do them, or talk about how doing unrelated, but still "productive" things makes it a lot easier to ignore the impending dealines... but I don't see why I can't just do that tomorrow instead.<sup>lol</sup>
