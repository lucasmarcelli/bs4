I've been doing Project Euler for year and have always wanted to document the process. Documentation is a good skill to have, and I am always trying to refine the best ways to help teach others programming skills. I won't necessarily be doing the problems in order, but it should be pretty close. I'll give thorough explanations for my code and my processes in understanding how to tackle the problems as I go along. However, the first couple problems are incredibly easy.

It wouldn't make much sense to do a long winded solution, so I'm going to use this post to simply introduce the idea. On my [Github](http://github.com/lucasmarcelli/euler) the euler repo will contain all the code I run to come to my solutions. Each post will solve one problem, and each problem will have a folder, including code that doesn't work.

Directly after solving problem 1, this comes up:

However I looked around online and there is already a ton of solutions out readily available, so I don't even feel bad. 

The first problem is nice and straightforward:

<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/github/lucasmarcelli/euler/blob/master/Problem-1/problem1.py?slice=0:2&footer=0"></script>

And the solution is similarly straightforward. Simply loop from 0 to 1000 and mod by 5 or 3. If either i mod 5 or i mod 3 is 0, add it to a running sum:

<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/github/lucasmarcelli/euler/blob/master/Problem-1/problem1.py?slice=3:&footer=0"></script>

This sum will give you the answer you need to solve the problem!
