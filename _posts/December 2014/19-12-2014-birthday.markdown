Yesterday was my birthday. I really enjoyed myself. I spent the day with Kelly just chilling and it was really nice. 

First my brother got me this sick whiteboard:

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/2014Dec/whiteboard.jpg" title="On a roll today.">
	<p>It's so large!<sup><sup>Thats what she said</sup></sup> Oh, it also gets shorter when not in use.<sup><sup>THATS WHAT SHE SAID</sup></sup>  </p>
</div>

I *love* whiteboards so much. There is no better tool for a programmer than a whiteboard. You can map out your problems and erase and change things as easy as typing things on an IDE. Every programmer should have a whiteboard. I think I have three or four in this house right now.

Then Kelly and I spent the day relaxing for the first time since exams started. 

After that came the scary part. Kelly made me dinner.

Kelly is the kind of girl who could burn water on the stove. I was very apprehensive but...

<div class="img-center">

	<p> Mmmmmmmm </p>
</div>

It turned out great! Asparagus, mashed potatoes, pork chops and carmalized apples. She picked a hard one but it tasted so good. 

Next was dessert. She made me rice krispy squares! I don't like cake all that much so it was really nice.

Then we did this:

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/2014Dec/fort.jpg" title="The rope is literally the reason this works.">
	<p> NO GIRLS ALLOWED </p>
</div>

Forts! I love forts! If you're ever feeling down, make a fort. 

That was my birthday.

Every year I also like to make a list of things I learned that year. It's often short because I'm stubborn. Here it is:

- It's okay to not be okay.
- Life has a funny way of working out if you set reasonable goals.
- Asking for help is key.
- Life is too short to waste with people or things you don't really like.
- I really do love what I do.

And lastly, thank you everyone for your birthday wishes.
