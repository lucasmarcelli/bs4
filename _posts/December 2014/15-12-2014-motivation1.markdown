I use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to serve this blog. One of my favourite parts about it is that it will regenerate your website locally as you save files without having to do anything, like so:

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/2014Dec/regen.png" title="Ignore the error.">
</div>

I was trying to work on the layout a bit, but no matter what I did when I saved, it would make me exit the process and restart it with `jekyll serve`.

I missed something small: 

`--watch`

The `watch` flag tells Jekyll to regenerate any changes, as long as they aren't part of `config.yml`.

I decided to take that silly mistake as a metaphor. Things won't change if you're not looking for the opportunity and acting accordingly. When different situations come your way, you have to make sure you see them for what they are and change what needs to be changed. 

This might all be a bit of a strech, but I'm in a motivating mood. 

And as always, I love you all <3.
