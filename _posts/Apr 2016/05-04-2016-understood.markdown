<p>
	Today has been quite the day for me from a introspective point of view. Due to my wonky brain chemistry, I'm having a bout of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization"> Depersonalization</a>, which affords me the unique chance to look into myself from a more outside point of view today. It has been a strange but illuminating experience, even if it is incredibly disturbing to see my hands typing this but not be <b>100%</b> sure they are really my hands.
</p>

<p>
	Since I know this feeling is going to pass, I can try to take any positive I can while doing anything and everything to avoid going into an anxiety spiral about how weird and strange the world is when you don't feel like yourself. 
</p>

<p>
	In that vein, I decided to take a serious look at myself and my motivations to see if I could find out what it is I really want and direction I should be taking myself with my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy">cognitive behavioral therapy</a>. The motivations that I never realized I had managed to surface thanks to the unique perspective I have today.
</p>

<p>
	I think at my core I love understanding things. I love finding out how stuff works. I will often get into wikipedia tunnels where I'm just researching something and it spirals into 100 tabs on various topics. I can tell you pretty much anything about anything because a cursory interest turns into a crazy afternoon of reading. For example, when I watched the West Wing for the first time, I wanted to know more about how the U.S. Government worked so I could appreciate the nuances better. Now, I know more about U.S. Federal and Constitutional law and practise than I have any business knowing as a Canadian. It makes me happy to know stuff.
</p>

<p>
	What I never realized is that a huge motivation in my personal relationships is that I really want to be understood on a deep level.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to explain exactly what I mean by that. Some people reading this will really understand what I mean and some people wont. Particular people in my life reading this will also probably know that they are literally the only person in the world that I honestly feel comfortable talking about certain topics with. The more people I have that I can talk to, the better I do, generally, so getting to the bottom of what makes someone alright to talk about seemed prudent.
</p>

<p>
	I took a look at why those particular people felt more comfortable as talking partners for certain subjects but not others. It wasn't just a function of how good of a friend they were to me. Some of my best friends are totally ignorant to entire swaths of my life because I don't feel like I can bring it up to them comfortably. There was something else that my subconcious was picking up on and making me feel like I can share it with them.
</p>

<p>
	As I looked at my motivations for telling them and what I feel towards them I realized that it's when I sensed they had a similar enough situation or past to me that they wouldn't just listen and try to help, but that they could truly <i>understand</i> the feelings I was having not only in the moment I am talking, but how it's affected me my whole life.
</p>

<p>
	It's nice to learn things about yourself, even on your hardest days. It's cool to solidly identify my motivations and hopefully this revelation on how my psyche works can lead to better relationships with the people I love. We spend so much of our time not knowing what we want and it's freeing to identify something even if it's a totally nebulous motivation.
