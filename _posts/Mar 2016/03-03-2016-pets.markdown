	I really, <i>really</i> love my pets. It's not for nothing, the little guys have actually gotten me through difficult times in my life over the last couple years.
</p>

<p>
	Growing up I wasn't allowed cats or dogs because my dad didn't want animals in the house. I have a vague memory of owning a couple Love Birds but I don't remember what happened to them. After being out on my own for a few years and the persistence of Kelly, I decided to adopt a cat. Best idea ever.
</p>

<h2>
	Bitty the Kitty
</h2>

<p>
	Bitty is the first animal that I can truly call mine. She is always purring, super affectionate and very complacent. She spends most of her day sleeping and looking for food, but every once in a while she becomes crazy. Bitty is a lap cat, and will occasionally come up and lay on top of you while purring. She knows her name and comes when called if she's in the mood.
</p>

	I swear she reaches Zen 80 times a day.
</p>

<p>
	Just look at that face! It's so relaxed. All the time. I wish I knew how to relax like she does. Having your entire body basically be the softest pillow must help.
</p>

<p>
	Bitty is the ideal cat to be honest. She is the definition of low matinence, she doesn't get mad when you go on vacation, and she lives her life in the most hedonisticly feline fashion she can. She gives you exactly what you put in. If you are affectionate and love her, she'll purr and sit with you. If you need some alone time, she'll leave you alone. If you think you need alone time but really what you need is a cat to come love you, she picks up on it and snuggles up. Bitty is always looking for food, or a comfy place to lay. She is truly happy because she is always comfortable and just loves it.
</p>

<p>
	Just having such a positive energy around me all the time has been a huge boost. Bitty is always happy and seeing that I can make a cat so truly content with its life gives me a lot of hope and motivation. She's actually sitting right beside me as I write this post. Here, I'll take a picture:

	Literally sat down while I was writing the paragraph above.
</p>

<h2>
	Kobe the "Dog" 
</h2>

<p>
	To be fair Kobe has been getting a lot more like a dog since we got him, but he still barely counts. 
</p>

<p class="img-text">
	<img src="/assets/img/posts/Mar2016/kobe.jpg">
	He's the cutest dog.

<p>
	Kobe is a rescue and we aren't really sure how old he is but the vet thinks between 3 and 5. He's some sort of mixture of shihtzu and yorkie and weighs about 6lb soaking wet. Kobe is Kelly's baby but I like the little guy too. When we got him he was afraid of his own shadow, but over the year we've had him he has slowly come out of his shell. Kobe is totally house trained and spends his day sleeping on the couch waiting for Kelly to come home. Once Kelly is home Kobe's actual dog side comes out and he wants to play and run, but he will abruptly decide to go inside with no warning.
</p>

<p>
	Kobe is a joy to have around. I don't know what happened at his previous home to have made him so timid but we do everything we can to spoil him here and it's working wonders. It's amazing to see him now. Always running around and jumping up on the couch, or being excited to go outside. These things seem like actions that any dog should be able to do... but Kobe isn't a real dog anyways.
</p>

<h2>
	Zuko the Kitty
</h2>

<p>
	Lastly is Zuko. 
</p>

<p>
	Zuko is special. Like actually special. The vet says he's developmentally delayed in the head, which makes a lot of sense. While walking, his feet don't really go in the places they should and runinng leads to falling... a lot. Nothing fazes him though, it can take him 3 or 4 tries to get on his favourite branch of the cat tree but he never loses confidence.
</p>

<p class="img-text">
	<img src="/assets/img/posts/Mar2016/zuko.jpg">
	Goddamn he is a cutie too.
</p>

<p>
	Zuko fell into my life when someone was giving away a free black cat. "Oh Joy! I will be able to avoid the adoption fees, and get the black cat I've always wanted." Hah. The night I got him he ran me a $300 vet bill and Bitty was not down with having him around. As the days (and dewormers + antibiotics) went on Bitty warmed up to Zuko and started becoming very motherly towards him. Zuko started developing a personality beyond "meow when hungry" and it turns out he's not a lap cat but loves to sit snuggled near you.
</p>

<p>
	Zuko spends his day on his cat tree sleeping, cuddling bitty while sleeping, or finding new and creative ways to destroy my belongings by accident. He is very energetic when he wants to be and loves chasing lasers at full speed directly into objects. I am really glad I got him, I feel a huge connection with the little jerk and I want to make sure his life is comfortable. Knowing that he is literally neurologically delayed and still takes on all his challenges is kinda inspiring.
</p>

<p>
	I love my pets. I really do. I think the world would be a better place if everyone had a cat like Bitty or Zuko, or a dog like Kobe. If you want to meet my pets, let me know.
