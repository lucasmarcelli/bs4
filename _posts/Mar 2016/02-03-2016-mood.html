<p>
	We wake up in a different mood than we went to bed as. Stuff happens in the day and we react, our plans go awry or we find $10 on the ground, and our day is different than it would have been if that hadn't happened. 
</p>

<p>
	Our bodies also have natural cycles in neurotransmitters and horomones. Our moods change that way too. 
</p>

<p>
	Tracking the way you feel over the day is actually super beneficial, and after you get a baseline it's possible to see how things like medicatio, diet and really any change are actually affecting your mood. As long as the self-reporting is done honestly it could have a huge effect on your overall mental health. 
</p>

<p>
	I started making this as an <a href="https://github.com/lucasmarcelli/Mood"> android app </a> but I have decided to begin by creating a strong backend with django and hosting a webapp, and branching out to mobile apps after, in order to better showcase my full-stack developer skills. I don't really know django super well yet, so this will serve to teach me a lot about that!
</p>

<p>
	The nice thing about doing this instead of using one of the apps availible is that I can make it exactly tailored to the needs I have. Hopefully someone else can get a bit of use out of it too.
