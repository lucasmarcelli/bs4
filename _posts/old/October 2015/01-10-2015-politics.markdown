Hoo boy. I've been getting in a ton of political arguemnts now that the election is coming closer. So a blog post seems like a good idea! 

Let's start with a political compass test to place where I *should* be:

</p>

That's honestly a lot more libertarian than I really feel, especially since I believe in big government. I'm a socialist for people and a capatalist (with regulations!) for business. I support high taxes on the rich and basic income for those who need it. I don't support a high minimum wage because that stifles innovation a heck of a lot more than raising corporate taxes to cover a basic income. I support weed legalisation and taxation similar to alcholhol. 

I should be voting NDP, since theoretically I align with them the most. But I'm voting liberal, because who can resist that hair? (And a ton of other reasons I'll get into)

I invite anyone and everyone to engage in debate with me about anything I've presented here. I will try to source things as much as possible, and I consider wikipedia a valid source. If you do get into a debate with me, do not simply ignore my arguments and continue talking, but louder. 

Let's get to the issues!

<h2> Canadian Issues </h2>

<hr>

<h3> Evidence Based Policy </h3>

This one is pretty simple. Canada has a mandate of [evidence based policy](http://www.horizons.gc.ca/eng/content/case-evidence-based-policy), that is, our policy has to be based on evidence gathered by an unbiased source.

This is done in the long-form census. Or it was, but Harper got rid of it to save money as an austerity measure.

[Harper has always been pretty anti-science.](http://www.academicmatters.ca/2013/05/harpers-attack-on-science-no-science-no-evidence-no-truth-no-democracy/) There can't be any evidence based policy without evidence, yet the tories are chugging along making tons of terrible policy.

Bring back the census.

<h3> Election and Senate reform </h3>

DO BOTH THESE THINGS.

I don't know how to fix the senate. Make it elected? Then whats the point? Make it unbiased? Impossible. Get rid of it? Maybe. Just change it please!

Election reform is complicated. We don't actually vote for anyone except our MP. Theorectially, I could become prime minister by going to the winning party in the election, and saying "Make me PM." If they agree, I am now the prime minister of Canada. Maybe a good first step is the create a truly *de jure* elected head of state, instead of having the Governer General, and then they form government, similar to the states. 

This would seperate the powers and then we couldn't have a quasi dictator with majority seats control everything. 

The simplest way to fix elections is to get rid of first past the post. 

Do a ranked voting system. Then I wouldn't sit here worrying that NDP and Libs will split the vote and the Conservatives win, which the majority of canadians do not want.  

<h3> Bill C-51 </h3>

I hate parts of bill C-51. I'm upset at the conservatives for introducing it in this form and I'm mad at it passing in this form.

"But Lucas, the Liberals voted FOR Bill C-51!"

Yeah. [It would have passed anyways though.](https://www.sfu.ca/~aheard/elections/results.html)

The liberals voted in favour of the bill because before the bill goes to senate, a committee is formed to change the bill to ready it for senate review. The committee is made up of members who voted for the bill. By voting for the bill, the liberals were actually taking a step in changing it to not be so draconian.

Bill C-51 isn't inherently bad. We need to move with the times and keep up with the criminals. The tories just have a different idea of when collection of evidence can occur. The liberals have promised to get rid of the parts of the bill i don't like, so they get a point here.

The NDP are losing point here because they are taking the same fear-mongering approach harper is, but just directing it the other way. Law enforcement still needs to be able to do their job Tommy, chill out and make sure you understand the technology before you talk about it.

<h3> $15 Minimum Wage </h3>

I do not support a minimum wage of $15, because it's too hard on small business. I think we should take the approach of [guarenteed minimum income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaranteed_minimum_income) because it gives the people who really need it the help they need without stifiling innovation.

Of course, none of this matters.

[The NDP are dirty, dirty liars.](http://thetyee.ca/News/2015/08/11/NDP-Federal-Minimum-Wage/)

The increase would effect less than 1% of canadians, yet it's a front and centre platform position as though it's going to be a national minimum wage required on businesses. This is so scummy, and so few people I talk to even know, because they are people who are in uni who want their wages to go up, but don't actually follow close enough to know it wont affect them.

Another thing the NDP has beeing doing is [saying one thing in english and another in french.](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ndp-tones-down-defence-of-face-covering-niqab-in-quebec/article23462219/) The NDP has just been a pretty scummy party this whole cycle.

<h3> Burkas, Niquabs and Xenophobia </h3>

Harper want to ban the Burka at the citenzhip ceremony, citing "cultural concerns."

Why? Canada is a cultural mosaic. We accept other cultures and only expect them to conform to the rule of law. It's what makes Canada amazing. Yet people will go insane on facebook (true story) and spout the most xenophobic rhetoric towards muslims.

The Burka and Niquab is a choice. For every 1 girl who is forced to wear it, there is 1000 who do it by choice. Yes, they may have been indoctrinated into wanting to wear it, but I was indoctrinated into being Catholic and there is nothing wrong with that. 

Forcing someone to take it off is just as opressive as forcing someone to put it on.

"But it covers the face in public and thats skecthy!"

Should we ban scarves in winter because they cover our face in public? 

In essence, there is nothing beyond "muh feels" to support the banning of the burka. 

The only time it should be asked to be taken off is in situations where it is neccesary to verify identity. Airports, courts, etc. If they don't want to take it off, they don't have to, but they can't go on a plane, or buy alchohol, or anything like that. 

However, there is no security concern in the citzenship ceremony. You don't even have to *be present* at the ceremoney! 

The worst part about all this though? [Only 2 women have ever asked to keep it on during the ceremony.](http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/andrew-coyne-to-uncover-or-not-to-uncover-why-the-niqab-issue-is-ridiculous)

Harper has duped the nation into giving him free news cycles for a total non-issue. 

God damn it.

<h3> Pipelines and Oil Interests </h3>

I support pipelines, just not in their current form. [We need oil, a lot of people don't realize just how reliant we are on oil beyond it as a use for fuel.](http://www.wintershall.com/en/company/oil-and-gas/oil-can-do-more.html)

However, I think this should honestly be nationalized. I don't think companies held by shareholders can be trusted to take care of this resource while also taking care of the environment. I don't support selling crude oil to countries with lower emmision standards than Canada. In fact, I think we should limit how much crude we sell and instead increase the potency of our energy sector by investing in modern refinery technology. This would have the nice side effect of creating tons low- and medium-skill jobs that will be sorely needed as automation replaces a lot of jobs over the next decade. (Self driving trucks are going to end an entire industry.)

I don't pretend to know enough about this to say *how* it could be nationalized, but that's still my opinion.

I also think Canada needs to introduce a carbon tax/credit system. The credit system curbs the negative GDP effect of a carbon tax by creating a whole new market, and it'll incentivse the companies to limit their carbon output so they either have credits to sell, or to lower taxes, but it avoids regulation.


<h2> Alchohol and other drugs </h2>

<hr>

<h3> Alchohol </h3>

Standard age of majority across Canada please. And while were on the topic, everyone should turn the same age on January 1st in the eyes of the law like in asia. It's total bullshit that I couldn't drink for a whole year when my friends could because I was 18 and they were 19. 

<ph3> Medical and Legal Marijuana </h3>

Although our government likes to call it "Marihuana," this plant is the topic of much debate lately. Canada, through a series of supreme court rulings, has made the ingestion of pot and pot-extracts legal for approved medical uses, and growing your own is expected to follow. The liberal party wants full legalization and taxation while the NPD only wants to increase the decriminalization.

There's not really a good reason for pot to be illegal, and tons of reasons for it to be legal such as:

- Medical applications.
- [It is safer than alchohol, by two orders of magnitude. This includes the effect of smoking it on your lungs.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4311234/)
- In addition to above, you can't overdose on it.
- [Colorado has only seen benefits, including a quarter million in new tax income from pot sales since legalising.](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/colorado-marijuana-tax-data)
- [Crime will go down. (Biased site, but they cite their sources.)](http://www.thecannabist.co/2015/05/21/colorado-marijuana-crime-stats/29784/)
- People will be a lot more chill. 
- People should be able to do what they want with their bodies.

The liberals have it right. Legalize and tax the shit out of it a la LCBO-type-deal. Let people grow it themselves, similar to how we let people make their own alchohol. There is no good reason beyond "muh feelings" to keep it illegal. 

<h3> Psilocybin and Cocaine and the Rest </h3>

Drugs are bad mmkay? Except in a hospital setting. Luckily Canada has pretty much abandoned it's schedule 1 designation and realized that ALL drugs have medical applications probably, even allowing doctors to use cocaine as a vasoconstrictor during open heart surgery, as it's a better vasoconstricter than pretty much anything else. I'm pretty happy about this, gotta love the supreme court.

<h2> Stupid Issues </h2>

<hr>

<h3> Quebec Seperation </h3>

Screw you Tom Mulcair. Noone cares. You keep shoehorning it into debates and it's really annoying.

<h3> New Stock Canadains </h3>

I am a new stock canadian, and this is under stupid issues because it hurts my head to think that this is even a thing.

Basically, non-natural born canadians (ie, both of your parents were born somewhere other than canada) are essentially second class citezens, with our citizenship now able to simply be taken away if suspected of terrorism.

Fuck you harper. This is so wrong I have no other words. Just, fuck you.


So that's most of the issues that matter to me. There's more but I'll save it for another time. 

Remember, go vote, preferably liberal, but vote nonetheless.
