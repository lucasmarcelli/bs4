I set lots of goals for myself. Some are reasonable, others are not. I know which ones are reasonable when I set them and those are the ones I really strive for. One such goal is 10 blog posts per month, which with the completion of this one, I have managed to keep!

However, some of the goals I set aren't being kept, and I can't figure out why. 

You'll notice that my project euler and bitty pages haven't been updated in a while. I'm not sure why. When I sit down to work on them I get pretty anxious and I have to do something else. It's strange seeing as they are perfectly reasonable goals to be working towards.

A lot of what stops me, and many like me, is my own thoughts. I get overwhelemed by the task ahead and I don't know how to start. Once I start I get on a roll and I can finish very easily. It's the thing I am working on the most out of everything.

I hate the feeling of being anxious to do *anything* but this is the feeling I hate the most. I know I'm not alone though, and I know that many people struggle with the same feelings. Thankfully we are moving towards a much better world for people with anxiety and other mental health issues. With hard work and some luck, I'll be doing better in no time.
