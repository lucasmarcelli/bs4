I haven't written a blog post in a while. 

Things like this are a good metric for how "well" you are doing. It's been a long time because Feburary has been absolutely hectic for me. So I'm writing this in the hopes of having a bit of a turn around.

I didn't know what to write about, so I just settled on my CS:GO progress. 

As of right now, I am in Silver Elite Master. I'm so close to Nova I can taste it. When that rank up finally happens it's gonna feel so sweet. 

Bitty has gotten into the habit of sitting at my computer when I play and blocking my HP bar. I let it slide because it's adorable and it happens literally *every* time.

Theres that. A post done.
