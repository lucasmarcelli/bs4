Hoo boy. It's been a while. Feburary was not kind to me, then neither was March... and then it all went downhill from there.

Then it all started getting better. And now it's pretty good, so why not start blogging again?

Where to start? Here's some stuff I've done since I've been gone:


- Made it to MGE in CS:GO! I'm a couple games from DMG :D
- Got a dog. His name is Kobe. There will be pics, soon. 
- Started my Grad thesis (tune in next time for a cool intro to it)
- Became 100% financially independant from my parents (ps, being poor is *hard*)
- Migrated this website to github-pages to avoid server costs (see above point about being poor)
- Completed my undergrad:

School is starting soon. I've had a pretty bummy summer to be honest, and I haven't actually registered for courses yet. I should do that tomorrow...

Anyways, thanks for reading. Love you all <3.
