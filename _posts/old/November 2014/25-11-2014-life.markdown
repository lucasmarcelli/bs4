Have you ever sat down and thought about the way you were a year ago?

Today I decided to do that.

It was kind of horrible. It is so weird how much change can happen in both someone's person and life in only a year. I'm not even remotely the same person I was then, but I like to think most of that change has been growth. 

I think back to some of the situations I was in, and how I decided to handle them a year ago. I wish I could go back in time and smack some sense into me, but I learned so many lessons that are making me a way better person. 

I wonder what year-from-now-me will look back on and cringe at? I've made a number of pretty big decisions recently and I have no idea if I any of my choices were the right ones or how they are going to alter my life. It's easy to fall into a trap of trying to live in a way that you think two-year-from-now-me will look back on happily. It's not possible to know, because our experiences shape us and guide us. It's important to stay grounded and live for the present you. 

The choices you make today can change your life. Sometimes you have to make the hard choices to make sure you can move forward and most of the time you have no idea if it is the right one. My life sort of did a 180 a little less than a year ago and its been a terrifying rollercoaster ever since, but one thing I look back on is really comforting:

*I'm doing better now than I was before.* Every single day this is true. Each day I am getting stronger and happier and my anxiety ebbs away. I have a new cat, apartment, Christmas tree and 5 year plan. I don't know what year-from-now-me would think about how I am living my life right now, but I know year-ago-me would be ecstatic. 

Let's hope I can say the same thing in a year!
