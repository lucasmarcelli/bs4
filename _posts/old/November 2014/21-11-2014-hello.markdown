I've never really been into blogs. I certainly never thought I'd actually write one. Lately it has felt like it would probably be a good idea to put some of my thoughts into a format that I can keep and share. I guess that I'm doing this because I want to start having projects in my life again.

The last few years have been crazy and tough and I never found time for me. Now I'm going to do the things that I want to do, and blog about whatever I feel like blogging about. 

Join me on a quest to find myself or something.

	Finding myself isn't as cool as Adventure Time though.
