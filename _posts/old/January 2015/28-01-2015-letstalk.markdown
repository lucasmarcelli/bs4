Today, every time you use the #BellLetsTalk hashtag on twitter or send any text from a bell phone, they will donate 5 cents to a mental health initiative. 

Stigma around mental health is real. Lots of people are afraid to get help because of this stigma. It's time to talk about the elephant in the room and one of the major things bell is donating to is initiatives centered around ending this stigma. 

I think it's really cool what bell is doing here. I know it's also a huge marketing ploy, but it's doing some real good.

So spam your twitter with #BellLetsTalk. There is no limit to how many times you can.

I love you all <3.
