About a week or so ago, knowledge of an impending exam sprung up on me. It was not expected and I had no idea I'd be taking this exam until this point. Needless to say, studying for it was a stressful experience.

My first reaction was one of extreme anxiety. There is a lot riding on this exam. Would I study enough in a week to pass? When I first look through the content, I freaked out completely and didn't think I'd be able to do it. It was overwhelming. But when I looked through the content I'd be tested on, I was able to break down my problem and I realized that it was totally doable. 

It's weird how you can know exactly what you have to do and in what timeframe it has to be done, but you'll still get the urge to procrastinate. I was so anxious for it that I ended up actually procrastinating a lot for a couple days. It was a lot easier getting myself back to work though, having already broke down the content I needed to learn, making it at least seem studyable.

I wrote the exam on Friday, and I'm glad I ended up doing it. It was a very stressful experience, to say the least, but overall I'm just happy with myself for managing to get it done. I'm not actually sure how I did, but I studied hard and I feel like I knocked it out of the park.

Update: Since actually writing this and posting it, I found out I passed the exam! Yay!
