I like music I didn't used to like.

It's really odd to realize that. I've changed a lot over the years and I already made a [post](/2014/11/25/life/) on how weird it is to look back and see how you've changed, but today I had a weird realization.

It might not seem like much, but young me was really opposed to rap music of any kind. It's weird how we can have these odd little reminders that things are changing each day. If you ever doubt that you're different, just take a look at something innocous like your music tastes or the way you like your toast in the morning. It might surprise you.
