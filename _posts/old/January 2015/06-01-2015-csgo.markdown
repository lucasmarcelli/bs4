I've recently started playing CS:GO competitive mode. It's a lot of fun. I got placed in Silver IV, which isn't bad considering how terrible I am. 

The biggest thing I've noticed is the lack of communication. The games where I communicate with my team, we all do a lot better. Since I got a mic, I've been winning all my games. Hopefully I'll be out of silver and into Nova soon.

Weird post, but I thought I'd share.
