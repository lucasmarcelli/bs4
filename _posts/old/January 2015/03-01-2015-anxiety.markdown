A little less than a year ago, I wrote a big [Facebook Post](https://www.facebook.com/lmarcelli/posts/10152018814027957?pnref=story) about mental health. Looking back at this moment, I realized that it was the start of a new era for me.

Nine months has passed and thankfully, I'm doing much better now than I was back then. Living with an Anxiety Disorder for so many years without even knowing that it was the reason I felt so terrible all the time was not a fun time.

The post I made addressed the issue of so people not having an understanding, and therefore failing to accommodate those with mental illness in the same way as a visible disability, or a bodily illness like cancer. I know that my story and opportunities aren't necessarily representative of everyone but over the last year I'm happy to say that I have been proven wrong.

Since being more open about my anxiety, I have found support at every turn. I had to take the first step myself, which is something we still need to work on making easier. Once I did though, the support came pouring in. Beyond that, I've learned how many people around me, many of whom I am friends with, are dealing with mental illness issues. 

If you're struggling this year, please reach out. I'm always here. 

I love you all <3.
