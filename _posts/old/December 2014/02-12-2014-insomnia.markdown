I really can not get to sleep. 

I'm writing this at 3:47 AM, though it probably wont be published until later. I'm not tired. I am just sitting here typing instead of in bed with my cat.

I didn't waste these hours at least. I did some website work! Yay! (also I played a lot of counter strike)

It started when I noticed load times going higher on the site after posting my previous post. I knew it was the first time my droplet at Digital Ocean needed to actually handle a bit of traffic, so I went to go check on it and looked at the graphs:

	Obligatory /r/dataisbeautiful
</p>

It really intrigued me to see the spikes in the data. I wanted to know more, but the graphs don't show anything more detailed than bandwidth. I decided to set up the blog with Google analytics to track my data!

I set off on the quest which would surely challenge my coding abili---

Wait... all I need to do is add this piece of javascript to my default.html? Man I love Jekyll layouts. 

This feels too easy. Is it really that easy?

	Yes. Yes it is.
</p>

Now I can see if people actually like my blog! Yay!

Wait, is that *realtime* visit data? Wow Google, that's pretty awesome.
