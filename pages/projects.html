	This is where my sleep lives. "Project" is a fairly nebulous term as well, this is really just a splashboard for my head.

			<h2>Code For Kids</h2>
			<p>
				This was the brainchild of my good friend Julian Nadeau, and together we founded, developed and brought Code For Kids to life as a not-for-profit business to teach kids about coding and design. Although we both decided to move on to other things, it was an amazing ride. All thats left is the twitter!

			<h2>Game made for Game Design Class</h2>
			<p>
				This is a game that myself and two other group members designed and implemented over the course of a semester! It's about controlling gravity to solve a platformer.

			<h2>Global Offensive Case Simulator</h2>
			<p>
				Not gonna lie, I've spent money on opening cases in Counter Strike. It's fun and it's a thrill to open a stattrak marble fade. We started making this simulator as a joke but as it shows, it's literally impossible to come out ahead unless you get <i>very</i> lucky. I know people who have spent thousands on cases and I hope that someone might see this and think twice before they drop real money on a 0.01% chance.

			<h2>Mood Tracker</h2>
			<p>
				A personal project of mine that might one day be helpful to others. It's a webapp to track your mood and other things over the day and identify problem times and habits. Tracking these things can really help mental health.

			<h2>My Old Website</h2>
			<p>
				Here is the old version of my website, which was just a modified theme. I wanted to improve my front-end skills so I made this site without the use of a theme (except bootstrap).
