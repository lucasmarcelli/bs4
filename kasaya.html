	The aforementioned game is similar to the popular indie game vvvvvvvv. You play a cute little penguin thing that can control its' personal gravity and the gravity of some objects. It's a twist on a basic platformer! Check out this gif of the prototype gameplay!

		The basic gravity manipulation.
	</p>

	<p>
		The main difficulty for players playing for the first time was understanding that changing gravity doesn't immediately change the direction that you are moving in. Once they figured that out, they were able to have fun navigating the maze of spikes and enemies present in the final game. Not shown above is also the ability to click and drag a vector to change the gravity of a specific object.
