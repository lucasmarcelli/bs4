	This is where my sleep lives. "Project" is a fairly nebulous term as well, this is really just a splashboard for my head.

			<h2>Global Offensive Case Simulator</h2>
			<p>
				Not gonna lie, I've spent money on opening cases in Counter Strike. It's fun and it's a thrill to open a stattrak marble fade. We started making this simulator as a joke but as it shows, it's literally impossible to come out ahead unless you get <i>very</i> lucky. I know people who have spent thousands on cases and I hope that someone might see this and think twice before they drop real money on a 0.01% chance.

			<h2>My Old Website</h2>
			<p>
				Here is the old version of my website, which was just a modified theme. I wanted to improve my front-end skills so I made this site without the use of a theme (except bootstrap).
