My Name is Lucas Marcelli. I have a degree in Computing from Queen’s, several years of experience and a passion for development.

Coding is both my livelihood and the way I challenge myself to grow each day. I think programming is an incredibly powerful tool not only for the consumer space, but as a way to teach problem solving and analytical skills. When I was in university I co-founded and managed a not-for-profit called [Code For Kids](wiki.codeforkids.ca), which really showed me how fast kids pick up coding concepts.

I’m much more than just a developer. I love astronomy, cats, cooking and video games. I’m passionate about mental health and self improvement. I love to explore new ways of incorporating my skills and interests into living well. Currently I’m dabbling in adult colouring books and journaling, along with a [webapp](mood.marcelli.ca) I’m developing to track mood changes over time.
