Mood changes through the day. For people with depression, anxiety or another mental illness, these fluctuations can mean the difference between having a normal day or spending it in bed. By tracking the way you feel often, it becomes possible to identify the things that help you and hurt you.

Inspired by [cognitive behavioral therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy), none of the apps on the market had everything I wanted. The beautiful thing about being a developer is you get to sit down and do it yourself if you want it badly enough!

Still in alpha, a huge update is in the works with a completely new way of tracking how you feel and a better design with Bootstrap 4. SSL coming soon, along with social media login. Built with Django, but considering a migration to Rails for a variety of reasons. Mood is totally open source. Feel free to submit contributions and suggestions, I appreciate it.
