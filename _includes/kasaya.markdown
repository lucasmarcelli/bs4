Similar in concept to the popular indie game [vvvvvvvv](http://store.steampowered.com/app/70300/).

The main difficulty for players on the first playthrough was figuring out that changing gravity doesn't immediately change the direction that you are moving in. It's counter intuitive to how you move around in day-to-day life, unless you fly planes. Upon getting used to it they were able to have fun navigating the maze of spikes and enemies present in the game. Not shown above is also the ability to click and drag a vector to change the gravity of a specific object.

The game ends with a sonic dunk. Try it out!
